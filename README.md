#ESP32-S3 Mini Testboard

Still in development. The board is JLCPCB enabled (for assembly).

I am designing this board to test the new ESP-S3 Mini for development of private boards. I am especially interested in I2S, the new RISC ULP (and using I2C while sleeping), usage of eMMC, USB OTG/Mass storage.


Drawing footprints and have to check the connections etc. Will be updated next weeks.
